# Resume

The contents of this repository is how I create my resume using
[Typst](https://typst.app). Its a modern alternative to LaTeX with an intuitive
and easy-to-use syntax.

Do note, the project is still work-in-progress and hence will take a while to
complete. But if you want to check out a template resume, check out this
[Google Doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jBHnaiQXpIVH91lHf3OvNA5hPdFpmi5PBK5wUE5C_0/edit?usp=drive_link)
for now.
